However, there is a paucity of adequate empirical evidence around gender and cultural dimensions of mental illness. In this paper we situate social media as a "lens" to examine these dimensions. We focus on a large dataset of individuals who self-disclose to have an underlying mental health concern on Twitter. Having identified genuine disclosures in this data via semi-supervised learning, we examine differences in their posts, as measured via linguistic attributes and topic models. Our findings reveal significant differences between the content shared by female and male users, and by users from two western and two majority world countries. Males express higher negativity and lower desire for social support, whereas majority world users demonstrate more inhibition in their expression. We discuss the implications of our work in providing insights into the relationship of gender and culture with mental health, and in the design of gender and culture-aware health interventions.},

In Study 1, we analyzed topics (groups of semantically similar words) across 10 million messages from over 52,000 Facebook users. Most language differed little across gender. However, topics most associated with self-identified female participants included friends, family, and social life, whereas topics most associated with self-identified male participants included swearing, anger, discussion of objects instead of people, and the use of argumentative language. In Study 2, we plotted male- and female-linked language topics along two interpersonal dimensions prevalent in gender research: affiliation and assertiveness. In a sample of over 15,000 Facebook users, we found substantial gender differences in the use of affiliative language and slight differences in assertive language. Language used more by self-identified females was interpersonally warmer, more compassionate, polite, and—contrary to previous findings—slightly more assertive in their language use, whereas language used more by self-identified males was colder, more hostile, and impersonal. Computational linguistic analysis combined with methods to automatically label topics offer means for testing psychological theories unobtrusively at large scale.},

  abstract = {As participant recruitment and data collection over the Internet have become more common, numerous observers have expressed concern regarding the validity of research conducted in this fashion. One growing method of conducting research over the Internet involves recruiting participants and administering questionnaires over Facebook, the world’s largest social networking service. If Facebook is to be considered a viable platform for social research, it is necessary to demonstrate that Facebook users are sufficiently heterogeneous and that research conducted through Facebook is likely to produce results that can be generalized to a larger population. The present study examines these questions by comparing demographic and personality data collected over Facebook with data collected through a standalone website, and data collected from college undergraduates at two universities. Results indicate that statistically significant differences exist between Facebook data and the comparison data-sets, but since 80\% of analyses exhibited partial η2 {\textless} .05, such differences are small or practically nonsignificant in magnitude. We conclude that Facebook is a viable research platform, and that recruiting Facebook users for research purposes is a promising avenue that offers numerous advantages over traditional samples.},

In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art computational personality recognition methods on a varied set of social media ground truth data from Facebook, Twitter and {YouTube}. We answer three questions: (1) Should personality prediction be treated as a multi-label prediction task (i.e., all personality traits of a given user are predicted at once), or should each trait be identified separately? (2) Which predictive features work well across different on-line environments? and (3) What is the decay in accuracy when porting models trained in one social media environment to another?},

However, Facebook is somewhat different from other Social Networking Sites as it demonstrates an offline-to-online trend; that is, the majority of Facebook Friends are met offline and then added later. The present research investigated how the Five-Factor Model of personality relates to Facebook use. Despite some expected trends regarding Extraversion and Openness to Experience, results indicated that personality factors were not as influential as previous literature would suggest. The results also indicated that a motivation to communicate was influential in terms of Facebook use. It is suggested that different motivations may be influential in the decision to use tools such as Facebook, especially when individual functions of Facebook are being considered.},

Interestingly, students with higher levels of loneliness reported having more Facebook friends. Extraversion, neuroticism, self-esteem and narcissism did not have significant associations with Facebook use.

Results revealed that extraverts more frequently updated about their social activities and everyday life, which was motivated by their use of Facebook to communicate and connect with others. People high in openness were more likely to update about intellectual topics, consistent with their use of Facebook for sharing information. Participants who were low in self-esteem were more likely to update about romantic partners, whereas those who were high in conscientiousness were more likely to update about their children. Narcissists’ use of Facebook for attention-seeking and validation explained their greater likelihood of updating about their accomplishments and their diet and exercise routine. Furthermore, narcissists’ tendency to update about their accomplishments explained the greater number of likes and comments that they reported receiving to their updates.},

Past studies have indicated that some patterns of Internet use are associated with loneliness, shyness, anxiety, depression, and self-consciousness, but there appears to be little consensus about Internet addiction disorder. This exploratory study attempted to examine the potential influences of personality variables, such as shyness and locus of control, online experiences, and demographics on Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a convenient sample using a combination of online and offline methods. The respondents comprised 722 Internet users mostly from the Net-generation. Results indicated that the higher the tendency of one being addicted to the Internet, the shyer the person is, the less faith the person has, the firmer belief the person holds in the irresistible power of others, and the higher trust the person places on chance in determining his or her own course of life. People who are addicted to the Internet make intense and frequent use of it both in terms of days per week and in length of each session, especially for online communication via e-mail, {ICQ}, chat rooms, newsgroups, and online games. Furthermore, full-time students are more likely to be addicted to the Internet, as they are considered high-risk for problems because of free and unlimited access and flexible time schedules. Implications to help professionals and student affairs policy makers are addressed.},

Although most people's social media use is non-problematic, a small number of users appear to engage in social media excessively and/or compulsively. The main objective of this study was to examine the associations between addictive use of social media, narcissism, and self-esteem. A cross-sectional convenient sample of 23,532 Norwegians (Mage=35.8years; range=16–88years) completed an open web-based survey including the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale ({BSMAS}), the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-16, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results demonstrated that lower age, being a woman, not being in a relationship, being a student, lower education, lower income, lower self-esteem, and narcissism were associated with higher scores on the {BSMAS}, explaining a total of 17.5\% of the variance. Although most effect sizes were relatively modest, the findings supported the notion of addictive social media use reflecting a need to feed the ego (i.e., narcissistic personality traits) and an attempt to inhibit a negative self-evaluation (i.e., self-esteem). The results were also consistent with demographic predictions and associations taken from central theories concerning “addiction”, indicating that women may tend to develop more addictive use of activities involving social interaction than men. However, the cross-sectional study design makes inferences about directionality impossible.},

We conducted an online experiment to study the relationship between content intimacy and willingness to self-disclose in social media, and how identification (real name vs. anonymous) and audience type (social ties vs. people nearby) moderate that relationship. Content intimacy is known to regulate self-disclosure in face-to-face communication: people self-disclose less as content intimacy increases. We show that such regulation persists in online social media settings. Further, although anonymity and an audience of social ties are both known to increase self-disclosure, it is unclear whether they (1) increase self-disclosure baseline for content of all intimacy levels, or (2) weaken intimacy's regulation effect, making people more willing to disclose intimate content. We show that intimacy always regulates self-disclosure, regardless of settings. We also show that anonymity mainly increases self-disclosure baseline and (sometimes) weakens the regulation. On the other hand, an audience of social ties increases the baseline but strengthens the regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that anonymity has a more salient effect on content of negative valence.The results are critical to understanding the dynamics and opportunities of self-disclosure in social media services that vary levels of identification and types of audience.},

To understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the U.S. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. We developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites ({SNS}) such as Facebook. We introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified {SNSs}. We find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., Facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. Finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. {CAUTION}: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.},

  abstract = {Facebook has been shown to be the most popular social network in the United States. Facebook not only has implications in the online world, but face-to-face connections are also affected by this medium. This study explores the uses of Facebook for self-disclosure behavior utilizing the uses and gratifications perspective. Using a convenience sample of Facebook users, this study examines individual and sociological factors as well as Facebook motives to discover the impact on depth, breadth, and amount of user self-disclosure. Path analyses showed that the Big Five personality factors, self-esteem, social cohesion, and motives contribute to self-disclosure dimensions. However, demographic variables did not impact disclosiveness. Limitations are discussed and directions for future research are proposed.},

The focus was on the sharing of important positive and negative life events related to romantic relationships, health, and work/school in relation to likelihood of sharing this type of information on Facebook and general attitudes toward privacy. An online survey of 599 adult Facebook users found that when positive life events were shared, users preferred to do so indirectly, whereas negative life events were more likely to be disclosed directly. Privacy shared little association with how information was shared. Implications for understanding the finer nuances of how news is shared on Facebook are discussed.},

Most correlations remained significant after controlling for income and education. A cross-sectional regression model based only on Twitter language predicted {AHD} mortality significantly better than did a model that combined 10 common demographic, socioeconomic, and health risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Capturing community psychological characteristics through social media is feasible, and these characteristics are strong markers of cardiovascular mortality at the community level.},

Using a U.S. national sample of adults aged 25 to 74 (N = 1031), the prevalence as well as the affective and physical correlates of daily stressors are examined. Respondents had at least one daily stressor on 40 percent of the study days and multiple stressors on 11 percent of the study days. The most common class of stressors was interpersonal tension followed by work-related stressors for men and network stressors (events that occur to close others) for women. Stressors that involved danger of loss were more prevalent than stressors in which loss actually occurred. Regression analyses showed that specific types of daily stressors such as interpersonal tensions and network stressors were unique predictors of both health symptoms and mood. }

abstract = {Abstract There has been considerable controversy about methods for assessing life stress. However, self‐report checklists and interview‐based measures (the predominant approaches used in current research) differ in several respects, ranging from basic definitions through theoretical assumptions. Most research comparing these two approaches has focused on global comparisons in predicting disorder, which fail to take into account more specific information on how the methods vary. The present article outlines three stages of assessment for life stress: definition, operationalization, and quantification. Detailed examination of these stages with a sample of depressed patients helps to demonstrate in an explicit manner how self‐report checklists and interview‐based methods differ at successive stages of the measurement process. Data are presented that indicate large endpoint discrepancies attributable to specific differences in the definitional and operational procedures used in the two assessment approaches. The nature of the discrepancies found is discussed, along with the implications for assessing life stress and testing its implications for health and well‐being.}

We examined the co-occurrence of specific ACEs and their relationship to current emotional distress in an international sample of adults without psychopathology. Participants were 1659 men and women recruited for an international neurocognitive-neuroimaging database from sites in the United States, Australia, England, and the Netherlands. Participants had no current or prior diagnosis of major depression, anxiety, substance abuse, or neurological brain disorder. The occurrence and age on onset of 19 ACEs was assessed by a self-report questionnaire (ELSQ), and current
symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). The relationship of specific ACEs to DASS symptoms was examined. Participants reported relatively high prevalence of ACEs. Only 27.6% of the sample reported no ACEs, while 39.5% reported one or two
significant experiences and 32.9% reported more than two ACEs. Rates of
most ACEs were quite similar across the three continents. Various ACEs
were significantly associated with current DASS severity, particularly ACEs involving emotional abuse, neglect, and family conflict, violence, and breakup. Finding nearly one-third of the sample reported three or more ACEs suggest a high prevalence of ELS in otherwise healthy “normal” adults
around the world. Associations between ELS and current emotional distress
suggest that these events have functional relevance and deserve further
investigation.}

abstract = {This paper presents evidence from three samples, two of college students and one of participants in a community smoking-cessation program, for the reliability and validity of a 14-item instrument, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.}

abstract = {The standard life events methodology for the prediction of psychological symptoms was compared with one focusing on relatively minor events, namely, the hassles and uplifts of everyday life. Hassles and Uplifts Scales were constructed and administered once a month for 10 consecutive months to a community sample of middle-aged adults. It was found that the Hassles Scale was a better predictor of concurrent and subsequent psychological symptoms than were the life events scores, and that the scale shared most of the variance in symptoms accounted for by life events. When the effects of life events scores were removed, hassles and symptoms remained significantly correlated. Uplifts were positively related to symptoms for women but not for men. Hassles and uplifts were also shown to be related, although only modestly so, to positive and negative affect, thus providing discriminate validation for hassles and uplifts in comparison to measures of emotion. It was concluded that the assessment of daily hassles and uplifts may be a better approach to the prediction of adaptational outcomes than the usual
life events approach. }

abstract = {Although arguments about how to measure psychological stress are typically based on implicit epistemological and theoretical assumptions, stress measurement has almost never been truly theory driven. The objective of this article is to address several measurement and research issues
that derive from my particular metatheoretical concepts of systems thinking, transaction, and process and from my substantive theoretical concepts, which center on appraisal and coping. These issues are illustrated with research on the Hassles Scale. I address four controversial issues with reasoned arguments, and, as might be anticipated, I take the view (a) that stress is mainly a subjective rather than objective phenomenon, (b) that it is
best measured as seemingly minor annoyances rather than major cataclysms, (c) that confounding-although a problem-does not account for the relationship between stress and adaptational outcomes, and (d) that any stress measure should assess the contents or sources of stress rather than merely its degree. In addition, I argue for increased emphasis on psychological content in
stress scales and for greater attention to the individual's larger adaptational context, to a systems theory perspective, and to the time periods during which stress is sampled. Finally, I argue that we should abandon the measurement of stress, which tends to be too unidimensional, in favor of measuring the degree and quality of the emotions of daily living.
Information derived from such measures could greatly expand our understanding of how individuals handle both positive and negative experiences. }

measurement of stressful life events in Mainland China, was administered along with the Chinese version of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist to 4054 Chinese "normal" subjects who were sampled from 24 sites across Mainland China. "Problems with Interpersonal Relationship" was the most commonly encountered psychosocial stressor in Chinese daily life. At least once a year, about 34% of normal Chinese subjects were stressed by being misunderstood or berated; 17% of married persons experienced difficulties with child rearing; 15%
of married women had troubles with mothers-in-law. These stressors strongly influenced the well-being of Chinese residing in Mainland China. Stressors in the categories of "Study" and "Health" also contributed substantially. The life events experienced and stressfulness perceived varied in different life stages. Similarly, the major patterns of psychological responses obtained from the Hopkins Symptom Checklist differed in age groups. Similar to reports from other cultures, death of spouse is the most stressful life event in China. On
the other hand, the rank order of stressfulness of several other stressful life events differed significantly across cultures. The impact of divorce was ranked more highly in most previous Western studies, whereas among the Chinese, death of a close family member received the second highest ranking. The total score of the Stressful Life Events Rating Scale for 99% of normal Chinese was below 74. A score over 74 suggests that the individual's psychosocial stress may be perceived as excessive or an overload and may be associated with a heightened risk of psychological and/or psychophysiological dysfunction(s).

Overall, student stress was primarily related to academic, personal, and negative life events. Approximately 8% of Chinese students exhibited high stress associated with attending the university whereas 74% exhibited low stress, and approximately 18% did not report any stress. The general pattern of stressful college events is similar to that found in American studies; however, the rank order of stressors is somewhat different between these findings and the results of American studies. The top academic stressors for Chinese university students were low learning efficiency and competition among students whereas the top academic stressors for American students
were related to examinations. Personal hassles for the Chinese students involved concerns that they were not being taught or educated properly and inadequate social skills. In contrast, the major personal stressors of American students were found to be associated with intimate relationships
and parental conflicts.

General Symptomatic Index of the SCL-90. The correlations, ranging from
.34 to .54, were unusually high and represent a sizable increase over those
which typically have been reported between life event scales and outcome
measures of adjustment. The Life Events Questionnaire was a significantly
better predictor of adjustment than the other three scales. This stronger
degree of predictability, however, occurred for females only, suggesting
that scores based upon weighing the stressfulness of events may be
unnecessary for males. Unweighted life event scores were shown to be
nearly equivalent to weighted scores when weighed by either of two
methods: (a) a standard group-derived rating or (b) the individual's own
rating of the stressful impact of events. Neither weighing method-standard
nor individual rating- was superior to the other in predicting adjustment.
Finally, undesirable events alone were shown to largely explain the relationship between life event scores and adjustment.

Fifty male and 62 female manufacturing employees (age range 16–55 years) assigned scores to each item on a slightly modified version of the LEI scale. The current sample consistently assigned higher weights to events/items than did the original sample, but there was high agreement in terms of item ranking. Some distinct age and gender differences in scoring were apparent, and are discussed further. It was concluded that when separate weightings are employed for age and gender groups, the LEI remains a useful tool for quantifying background levels of stress in both workplace stress audits and epidemiological studies where statistical control for non‐occupational sources of stress is required.

abstract = { Background:

Adolescence can be a stressful time for children, parents and adults who work with teens. We believe that a scale measuring the events perceived as stressful by an average Indian adolescent is necessary due to the presence of irrelevant items and absence of items related to our culture on foreign scales.

Aim:

This study was done to adapt and test the validity of a scale measuring stress caused due to life events in an Indian adolescent; to assess clinical value of the instrument in exploring causal relationships between stressful events and behavioral problems; and to compare the degree of overlap in stress-causing events between adolescents and their parents during the same timeframe.

Materials and Methods:

An adolescent life event stress scale (ALESS) containing 41 items was administered to 156 adolescents for formulation and 102 adolescents for validation. A third set of 112 adolescents was used to compare ALESS scores with child behavior checklist (CBCL) scores and parental stress scores due to life events.

Results:

The comparison showed a strong positive correlation with CBCL scores with a model fit (r2 = 0.32) and a weak positive correlation with parental stress (Pearson's coefficient = 0.011) due to life events.

Conclusion:

Thus, a life event scale for adolescents was especially adapted to the Indian conditions.

In the weight assignment system that leads to a single presumptive stress score, it was predicted that events remote in time have less influence than recent events. The reliability of weight assignment was checked in S groups (a total of 358 normal adults and 1,055 psychiatric outpatients) that differed by sex, age, and status. Results indicate that women weighted life events as more stressful than did men; other differences in groups were less important. In spite of the sex differential, review of these data suggests use of the same weight assignments for all subgroups rather than differential weighting by sex and age. Reliability was also checked by test and retest methods: In contrast to common sense expectation, a disappointingly low level of reliability was found. Implications for investigative use of life events questionnaires are discussed. (61 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

The studies reported here describe the performance of the LEC in two samples: college undergraduates and combat veterans. The LEC exhibited adequate temporal stability, good convergence with an established measure of trauma history—the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ)— and was comparable to the TLEQ in associations with variables known to be correlated with traumatic exposure in a sample of undergraduates. In a clinical sample of combat veterans, the LEC was significantly correlated, in the predicted directions, with measures of psychological distress and was strongly associated with PTSD symptoms.

Only a small percentage of married/cohabiting couples reported engaging in social media infidelity-related behaviors; however, more engagement in infidelity-related behaviors on social media was significantly related to lower relationship satisfaction, higher relationship ambivalence, and greater attachment avoidance and anxiety in both women and men. Additionally, attachment anxiety and gender interacted with relationship satisfaction in predicting online infidelity-related behaviors when controlling for other variables.

Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that two factors explained 59 \% of the variance regarding Facebook behaviors: Partner Facebook Maintenance ({PFM}) and Actor Facebook Maintenance ({AFM}). Two structural equation models were created, one proposing that {PFM} and {AFM} would predict Actor Love and Partner Love when controlling for length of relationship, relationship status, and gender, the other proposing that Actor Love and Partner Love would predict {PFM} and {AFM}. Overall analysis indicates good model fit for both models. These results suggest that partners who perceive higher levels of love in their relationship actually participate in less Facebook Maintenance behaviors, and couples who engage in more Facebook Maintenance behaviors experience less love in the relationship.

Facebook friends lists did act as memory primers for potential partners, but only for sexual partners, and the effect was stronger for men than it was for women. However, identifying potential partners through Facebook actually lowered a person's perceptions of the quality of their alternatives. In contrast, merely thinking about potential alternatives from one's social sphere lowered relationship satisfaction and commitment with one's current committed partner.

There is a growing debate among scholars about how the internet can enhance existing relationships or facilitate the development of new relationships, including illicit ones. Research in this field has predominately focused on cybersex, pornography, and social networking sites, with a few studies on internet infidelity. A clear definition of internet infidelity is important theoretically, empirically, and therapeutically; however, research in this area is limited. This chapter explores the different types of infidelity and the challenges in defining internet infidelity. It offers a critical review of the existing literature to make sense of the complexities and challenges in carrying out research on this subject.

To understand and characterize behaviors around breakup disclosures, we analyzed survey responses from 119 {US} Facebook users who reported experiencing a recent breakup. Using mixed methods, we find that those perceiving Facebook as a more efficient disclosure medium are more likely to announce breakups. We show how media ideologies around Facebook breakup disclosures vary; yet people assume others hold similar beliefs about what is appropriate. We contribute to self-disclosure and online identity literature by identifying two new ways people engage in disclosure and self-presentation on social media: announcements, which highlight how social media can serve as efficient one-to-many disclosure sources, and private status change behaviors, a reflexive means of self-presentation. Understanding breakup disclosures provides insight into designing social media to better enable users to find support during difficult life transitions.},

We conducted an online experiment to study the relationship between content intimacy and willingness to self-disclose in social media, and how identification (real name vs. anonymous) and audience type (social ties vs. people nearby) moderate that relationship. Content intimacy is known to regulate self-disclosure in face-to-face communication: people self-disclose less as content intimacy increases. We show that such regulation persists in online social media settings. Further, although anonymity and an audience of social ties are both known to increase self-disclosure, it is unclear whether they (1) increase self-disclosure baseline for content of all intimacy levels, or (2) weaken intimacy's regulation effect, making people more willing to disclose intimate content. We show that intimacy always regulates self-disclosure, regardless of settings. We also show that anonymity mainly increases self-disclosure baseline and (sometimes) weakens the regulation. On the other hand, an audience of social ties increases the baseline but strengthens the regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that anonymity has a more salient effect on content of negative valence.The results are critical to understanding the dynamics and opportunities of self-disclosure in social media services that vary levels of identification and types of audience.},

We developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites ({SNS}) such as Facebook. We introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified {SNSs}. We find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., Facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. Finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. {CAUTION}: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.},

With the advent of online research techniques, scientists are looking for new places where participants can be recruited online, in order to overcome the limitations of current sources and avoid the issues associated with sample overuse. The social media website “Reddit” is a potential source for recruitment, as it allows for free and rapid data collection from large samples, while enabling researchers to target specific populations when needed. The ability to recruit for free is especially important because it enables students and early career researchers, for whom even low recruitment costs can be prohibitive, to benefit from the opportunity of conducting research that they otherwise would not be able to. The current article therefore aims to bring this prospective, untapped resource to the attention of the research community. The article discusses current online recruitment sources and their limitations, provides an overview of Reddit, validates its use for research purposes, examines participation data from previous studies which recruited through Reddit, highlights its advantages and limitations as a participant pool, and suggests guidelines that can improve recruitment and retention rates for scientists looking to use Reddit for their research.},

In addition, few measurement tools have established reliability and validity. Findings from this conceptual analysis suggested four of the most frequently used defining attributes of social support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal. Social network, social embeddedness, and social climate were identified as antecedents of social support. Social support consequences were subsumed under the general rubric of positive health states. Examples were personal competence, health maintenance behaviours, perceived control, sense of stability, recognition of self-worth, positive affect, psychological well-being, and decreased anxiety and depression.

When attempting to remove such demographic information using adversarial training, we find that while the adversarial component achieves chance-level development-set accuracy during training, a post-hoc classifier, trained on the encoded sentences from the first part, still manages to reach substantially higher classification accuracies on the same data. This behavior is consistent across several tasks, demographic properties and datasets. We explore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial component. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the adversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features.},

	abstract = {The wide use of social media sites and other digital technologies have resulted in an unprecedented availability of digital data that are being used to study human behavior across research domains. Although unsolicited opinions and sentiments are available on these platforms, demographic details are usually missing. Demographic information is pertinent in fields such as demography and public health, where significant differences can exist across sex, racial and socioeconomic groups. In an attempt to address this shortcoming, a number of academic studies have proposed methods for inferring the demographics of social media users using details such as names, usernames, and network characteristics. Gender is the easiest trait to accurately infer, with measures of accuracy higher than 90 percent in some studies. Race, ethnicity and age tend to be more challenging to predict for a variety of reasons including the novelty of social media to certain age groups and a lack of significant deviations in user details across racial and ethnic groups. Although the endeavor to predict user demographics is plagued with ethical questions regarding privacy and data ownership, knowing the demographics in a data sample can aid in addressing issues of bias and population representation, so that existing societal inequalities are not exacerbated.},

Prior quantitative work on gender often treats this social variable as a female/male binary; we argue for a more nuanced approach. By clustering Twitter users, we find a natural decomposition of the dataset into various styles and topical interests. Many clusters have strong gender orientations, but their use of linguistic resources sometimes directly conflicts with the population-level language statistics. We view these clusters as a more accurate reflection of the multifaceted nature of gendered language styles. Previous corpus-based work has also had little to say about individuals whose linguistic styles defy population-level gender patterns. To identify such individuals, we train a statistical classifier, and measure the classifier confidence for each individual in the dataset. Examining individuals whose language does not match the classifier's model for their gender, we find that they have social networks that include significantly fewer same-gender social connections and that, in general, social network homophily is correlated with the use of same-gender language markers. Pairing computational methods and social theory thus offers a new perspective on how gender emerges as individuals position themselves relative to audiences, topics, and mainstream gender norms.},

We analyze a sample of 123,000 Twitter users and 25 million of their tweets to investigate the relation between the opinions and emotions that users express and their predicted psychodemographic traits. We show that the emotions that we express on online social networks reveal deep insights about ourselves. Our methodology is based on building machine learning models for inferring coarse-grained emotions and psychodemographic profiles from user-generated content. We examine several user attributes, including gender, income, political views, age, education, optimism, and life satisfaction. We correlate these predicted demographics with the emotional profiles emanating from user tweets, as captured by Ekman's emotion classification. We find that some users tend to express significantly more joy and significantly less sadness in their tweets, such as those predicted to be in a relationship, with children, or with a higher than average annual income or educational level. Users predicted to be women tend to be more opinionated, whereas those predicted to be men tend to be more neutral. Finally, users predicted to be younger and liberal tend to project more negative opinions and emotions.We discuss the implications of our findings to online privacy concerns and self-disclosure behavior.},

Examining two recent cases of what are defined as “toxic technocultures” (\#Gamergate and The Fappening), this work describes how Reddit’s design, algorithm, and platform politics implicitly support these kinds of cultures. In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit’s karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered. This research is informed by the results of a long-term participant-observation and ethnographic study into Reddit’s culture and community and is grounded in actor-network theory.},

The site’s 274 million monthly users share, discuss, ‘up-vote’ and ‘down-vote’ a wide array of content found on the internet: news, pictures of cats, deep philosophical discussions, scientific breakthroughs, pornography, advice columns, GIFs of people falling over—reddit has it all. The most ‘up-voted’ content rises to the top of the site, while less current and less interesting content ‘sinks’. The site is divided into more than 10 thousand active (and many more less active) ‘subreddits’, framed as communities organised around a particular topic. In this chapter, by looking at four case studies, I push beyond the contentious descriptor of reddit as ‘a type of online community’ to consider the systems of belonging on reddit (via everyday labour) as more akin to the temporally situated, purposive neo-tribes theorised by Maffesoli (1996) and Bennett (1999) Reddit, and many of the site’s subreddits, operate on a very specific shared set of languages and conventions, rules, expectations, and rituals. Reddit neo-tribes can crystallise over time (as per Robards and Bennett), but they are largely ephemeral, readily aligning with Maffesoli’s (1996) original conceptualisation.},

The sample consisted of 200 male and female young adults between the ages of 18 and 35. The findings reveal that while very few of the respondents themselves would consider engaging in an online romantic relationship simultaneously with a committed relationship, a small section of the sample agreed that seeking out romantic or sexual encounters online could be an escape from IPV. More significantly, almost one-third of the sample agreed to the likelihood of IPV if their partner were to find out about such infidelity. The findings point to a possibly important relationship between IPV and online infidelity, and how young adults perceive the two phenomena in relation to each other and separately, in the current Indian context.

It attempts to outline a research agenda for social policy in relation to one particular aspect of internet use, that of on-line self-help and social support – what we term here virtual-community care . The article presents data on patterns of home based internet use in Britain and outlines some contemporary debates in social policy about the importance of self-help and social support. It also considers how the internet is being used for self-help and social support with a particular emphasis on the emerging situation in Britain. Three illustrations of on-line self-help and social support are presented: two from newsgroups, which are part of the ‘uk.people.* hierarchy’: one concerned with disability and one with parenting issues; and one web based forum concerned with issues surrounding mortgage repossession. Drawing upon this illustrative material the article discusses some emergent issues for contemporary social policy discourse: the rise of self-help groups; the privileging of lay knowledge and experience over the ‘expert’ knowledge of health and welfare professionals; the nature of professional-client relationships; the quality and legitimacy of advice, information and support; dis/empowerment; and social exclusion. }

We specifically examine patterns of activity, emotional, and linguistic correlates for childbirth and postnatal course. After identifying childbirth events on Twitter, we analyze daily posting patterns and language usage before and after birth by new mothers, and make inferences about the status and dynamics of changes in emotions expressed following childbirth. We find that childbirth is associated with some changes for most new mothers, but approximately 15\% of new mothers show significant changes in their online activity and emotional expression postpartum. We observe that these mothers can be distinguished by linguistic changes captured by shifts in a relatively small number of words in their social media posts. We introduce a greedy differencing procedure to identify the type of language that characterizes significant changes in these mothers during postpartum. We conclude with a discussion about how such characterizations might be applied to recognizing and understanding health and well-being in women following childbirth.},

The focus was on the sharing of important positive and negative life events related to romantic relationships, health, and work/school in relation to likelihood of sharing this type of information on Facebook and general attitudes toward privacy. An online survey of 599 adult Facebook users found that when positive life events were shared, users preferred to do so indirectly, whereas negative life events were more likely to be disclosed directly. Privacy shared little association with how information was shared. Implications for understanding the finer nuances of how news is shared on Facebook are discussed.},

A total of 218 college students who had experienced the breakup of a romantic relationship during the preceding 12 months produced a written narrative of the relationship and subsequent breakup using an expressive writing procedure. Participants used more negative emotion, cause, sensory, and first person singular words when describing the breakup in comparison to describing the period when they were still dating. In addition, greater avoidance of the breakup predicted greater use of negative emotion, first person singular and third-person pronouns, and less use of cognitive words. Conversely, levels of grief predicted less use of causal words and greater use of first person singular pronouns. The authors argue that use of cognitive words reflect an active search for meaning and understanding of the stressful event.},

Drawing on current theories, the author first presents an integrated model of meaning making. This model distinguishes between the constructs of global and situational meaning and between "meaning-making efforts" and "meaning made," and it elaborates subconstructs within these constructs. Using this model, the author reviews the empirical research regarding meaning in the context of adjustment to stressful events, outlining what has been established to date and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of current empirical work. Results suggest that theory on meaning and meaning making has developed apace, but empirical research has failed to keep up with these developments, creating a significant gap between the rich but abstract theories and empirical tests of them. Given current empirical findings, some aspects of the meaning-making model appear to be well supported but others are not, and the quality of meaning-making efforts and meanings made may be at least as important as their quantity.

	abstract = {The use of cognitive words in narratives of negative events and the association with the meaning-making process were examined. Cognitive word use, a past predictor of beneficial outcomes from the expressive writing intervention, was related to the process of meaning making in Study 1. This finding was true for memories that lacked psychological closure. In Study 2, we replicated the finding that cognitive word use is related to the meaning-making process using an alternative measure of meaning making. However, cognitive word use was not found to be related to the outcome of meaning making. The extent to which participants were engaged in meaning-making was negatively related to narrative coherence. These results suggest that the meaning-making process may be a precursor to achieving narrative coherence. Additionally, participants randomly assigned to expressive writing instructions engaged in the meaning-making process to a greater extent than participants asked to simply describe their negative event, suggesting that expressive writing encourages the meaning-making process.

	abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between using the social networking site known as Facebook and negative interpersonal relationship outcomes. A survey of 205 Facebook users aged 18–82 was conducted using a 16-question online survey to examine whether high levels of Facebook use predicted negative relationship outcomes (breakup/divorce, emotional cheating, and physical cheating). It was hypothesized that those with higher levels of Facebook use would demonstrate more negative relationship outcomes than those with lower use. The study then examined whether these relationships were mediated by Facebookrelated conﬂict. Furthermore, the researchers examined length of relationship as a moderator variable in the aforementioned model. The results indicate that a high level of Facebook usage is associated with negative relationship outcomes, and that these relationships are indeed mediated by Facebook-related conﬂict. This series of relationships only holds for those who are, or have been, in relatively newer relationships of 3 years or less. The current study adds to the growing body of literature investigating Internet use and relationship outcomes, and may be a precursor to further research investigating whether Facebook use attributes to the divorce rate, emotional cheating, and physical cheating.},

Only a small percentage of married/cohabiting couples reported engaging in social media infidelity-related behaviors; however, more engagement in infidelity-related behaviors on social media was significantly related to lower relationship satisfaction, higher relationship ambivalence, and greater attachment avoidance and anxiety in both women and men. Additionally, attachment anxiety and gender interacted with relationship satisfaction in predicting online infidelity-related behaviors when controlling for other variables.

Exploring the processes related to discovery of Facebook infidelity behaviors adds another layer to understanding Internet infidelity and highlights the behaviors unique to Facebook infidelity. Stories about cheating (N = 90), taken from the website {FacebookCheating}.com were analyzed using grounded theory methodology to create a process model of discovery. Researchers sought to answer four questions: (1) What is the experience of nonparticipating partners when their partners have engaged in infidelity behaviors on Facebook? (2) What are the basic social processes that occur when discovering the infidelity behaviors? And, (3) What are the basic psychological processes that occur? (4) What similarities or differences exist between the current research on offline and online infidelity and the process model from the current study? The categories are arranged in a process model, which depicts these processes as well as the emotional experience of the nonparticipating partner. The model highlights important phases through which the nonparticipating partner cycled following the discovery of the infidelity. These include appraising the boundary damage, acting on the appraisal, and making a decision about the relationship. Suggestions for clinical intervention based on this process are provided. Future research implications are also discussed.},

Results indicated that anxious attachment predicted relational investment but also seeking relationship alternatives; avoidant attachment was negatively related to investment but positively related to seeking alternatives. Investment predicted commitment, whereas seeking alternatives was negatively related to commitment. Commitment predicted emotional distress after the breakup. Distress predicted partner monitoring immediately following the breakup, particularly for those who did not initiate the breakup, as well as current partner monitoring.

Partners in a relationship may create digital possessions frequently. However, after a relationship ends, individuals typically seek to disconnect from their ex-partner. This becomes difficult due to the partners' interwoven digital presence and digital possessions. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study exploring individuals' experiences of relationship break up in a digital context, and discuss their attitudes towards digital possessions from those relationships. Five main themes emerged: digital possessions that sustain relationships, comparing before and after, tainted digital possessions, digital possessions and invasions of privacy, involved and emotional reminiscing. Design opportunities were identified in managing attitudes towards digital possessions, disconnecting and reconnecting, and encouraging awareness of digital possessions.},

Those participants reading about high exclusivity messages reported more negative emotion and were more likely to imagine being confrontational. Threat perception and negative emotion both predicted confrontational behavior. There was an indirect effect of message access exclusivity on threat perception through negative emotion; there was no direct association between exclusivity and threat perception.

	abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean +/-1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option--an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file--so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

We were particularly interested in understanding what has been studied in relation to immigrant college students, as they are especially at risk for depression. Searching three databases, {ACM} Digital Library, {PubMed}, and {IDEALS}, we found 881 research articles. Based on our criteria, 78 research papers were included in our analysis. Although social media use is common among college students and depression is an issue for many immigrants and college students, we found few studies that focused specifically on college students, and we identified no studies on immigrant college students or college-aged immigrants. The research articles focused primarily on Twitter and general social media usage (rather than specific social media platforms) and commonly employed qualitative methods. We identify four gaps in the existing literature, why they matter, and how future research (our own included) can begin to address them.},

	abstract = {Background
The internet and social media provide an unprecedented opportunity to transform early psychosis intervention services. This study aimed to capture concerning patterns of social media activity associated with the onset and persistence of psychotic symptoms.

Methods
Facebook and Twitter archives were extracted from over 150 participants with psychotic disorders, mood disorders and healthy controls. Machine learning was used to build classifiers aiming to identify patterns and distinguish between groups.

Results
Linguistic analysis of Twitter commentary identified significantly increased use of interpersonal pronouns (p {\textless} 0.001), decreased emphasis on friendship (p {\textless} 0.001) and increased emphasis on health (p {\textless} 0.001) in individuals with psychosis. Preliminary classifiers correctly recognized participants with psychotic disorders (n=62) from healthy controls (n=24) with an average accuracy of 80\% and distinguished participants with psychosis from those with mood disorders (n=39) with an average accuracy of 70\%. Further analysis identified shifts in language use of participants with psychosis who experience a relapse (n=18) including significant increases in the use of swearing (p{\textless}0.05), first-person pronouns (p{\textless}0.05) and negations (p{\textless}0.05). We additionally identified significant differences in the profile pictures (p{\textless}0.005) and structure of messages posted (p{\textless}0.005) by youth with psychosis who experienced a psychotic relapse.

Discussion
Identifying markers in social media activity associated with worsening psychotic symptoms offers the prospect that social media may be a clinically useful tool to identify patients in the earliest phases of relapse.},
