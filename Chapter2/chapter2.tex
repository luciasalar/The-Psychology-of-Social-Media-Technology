The 4P model is a biopsychosocial approach to analyze mental health development and progression \cite{}. The 4P model suggests that there are four types of factors contribute to development of all psychological disorders, each type of factors can be further divided into biological factors, psychological factors and social factors. The four types of factors are: predisposing risk factors, precipitating risk factors, perpetuating risk factors and protective factors. 

Predisposing risk factors make an individual more susceptible to a psychological disorder. For example, genetic component, gender differences, personality traits and parental modeling. Precipitating risk factors contribute to the onset of psychological disorders, for instance, traumatic event or stressful life events. Perpetuating factors maintain the symptoms span from psychological disorders, such as chronic stress, cognitive bias, social stigma, social roles. Finally, protective factors build up the resilience of an individual \cite{}. Figure \ref{tab:4P} demonstrates the relationships of these factors. Note that some of the precipitating factors can be perpetuating factors if they exist for a long time. 

We attempt to study some of the factors via the lenses of social media platform. Social media behaviors reflect psychological and social factors to some extend but it's nearly impossible to inspect biological factors from social media data, except for gender differences. Another factor that is difficult to inspect in social media at this stage is childhood experience. As a result, my PhD project will only focus on inspecting factors that are available in social media data.

\subsection{predisposing factors}
When individuals are exposed to a stressor, predisposing factors influence how people experience stress and how they cope with it. These factors affect an individual in the probability to encounter stressors. Note that people select their environment and shape them. They also affect people's tendency to react to situation and their tendency in coping. \cite{} (Suls and Martin, 2005; Vollrath, 2001; cf. Watson, David and  Suls, 1999)

\subsubsection{personality}

Consistent evidence has been found that some dimensions in personality co-occurred with certain mental disorders, but there's no direct link between personality and mental health problems. Personality is largely shaped by child-rearing practices and family interactions (cite). As a result, the link between personality and mental health can be traced back to family rearing style.

There are many types of personality models, such as, Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI),Cattell’s 16 Factor Model, Big Five Model, among which the five factor personality model (Big5) is most widely adopted in personality studies. Big5 suggests five board dimensions to describe human personality:  openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. There has been consistent evidence showing that personality plays an important role in the experience of stress. Individuals with high neuroticism often experience more negative emotions (cite), and negative emotions affect how an individual cope with stress \cite{kiecolt2002emotions}. Neurotism has been found to be an increase risk factor for depression and anxiety. \cite{talley1986association,cattell1961meaning} Internet addiction often occurs in introverted people \cite{xiuqin2010mental}. However, personality and mental health do not have a direct causation relationship. There are many mediating factors between personality types and mental disorders. For example, rumination and worrying mediate neuroticism and depression \cite{roelofs2008rumination};

\subsubsection{self-disclosure}
Self-disclosure is the amount of information an individual disclose to significant others. There are three major parameters of self-disclosure: the amount of information disclosed; depth of the information disclosed and the time spent on describing the information. The evaluation of self-disclosure must involve the three parameters cite(self-disclosure, a literature review).


Self-disclosure is important to mental health problem because it affects one's help seeking behaviors. Individuals with high self-disclosure level are more likely to seek professional help (Hinson and Swanson, 1993). Self-disclosure is also a critical problem for psychotherapist. On one hand, patients often go to psychotherapy to seek solution to loneliness, which is a result of difficulty in building intimate relationships. One the other hand, patients wish to conceal themselves. (The Shared Experience and Self-Disclosure Martin Fisher, Self-Disclosure in the Therapeutic Relationship). 

Self-disclosure is, again, shaped by the family rearing style. Fisher(1982) proposes that when infant/child involves in a communication with significant others, they receive positive or negative feedback. The feedback provided form a feedback loop. The positive feedback loop encourage a child to disclose more, whereas, the negative feedback loop does the opposite. Failing to disclose results in an accumulation of secrets, the greater the degree of secrets, the more alienation of self and others. cite() Besides family rearing style, self-disclosure is also affected by gender, culture, race and the relationship with the significant others.

\subsubsection{self-esteem}
Self-esteem is the beliefs and evaluation individuals hold about themselves (Burns, 1982). These beliefs are inner influences that guild and government individuals through out their lives. The development of self-esteem is dependent on support and approval from significant others and self-perceived competence in the domains that are important to self. The distance between ideal self and real self is critical to the development of self-esteem cite. (Self-esteem in a broad-spectrum approach for mental health promotion)

Self-esteem is a protective factor in mental health because self-esteem and the ability to face challenge determine what happens to an individual in challenging situations. Conversely. poor self-esteem plays a critical role in the development of mental disorders. cit (Self-esteem in a broad-spectrum approach for mental health promotion). High self-esteem is related to better life satisfaction (Zimmerman, 2000).  Self-esteem is a strong predictor of subjective well-being (Furnham and Cheng, 2000). 

Whereas, Low self-esteem lead to maladjustment  (Garmezy, 1984), depressed mood and depressive disorders (Rice et al.,1998; Dori and Overholser, 1999). Self-esteem alone has no direct contribution to depression, but self-esteem interact with accumulate stress highly predicts depression (Miller et al., 1989).  Shin (Shin, 1993) found that when self-esteem, social support and cumulative stress are introduced to the regression analysis of depression, only self-esteem accounts for significant additional variance (cite). 

\subsubsection{gender and cultural differences}

A large amount of literature has found significant gender differences in depressive and anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, gender is an influential factor to help-seeking behavior. One one hand, women in genderal have higher self-disclosure level, thus they are more willing to seek help. On the other hand, gender stereotype such as women are prone to affective disorder and men are prone to substance use disorder also reinforce the stigma and affect the help seeking behaviors. Gender differences also exist in the comorbid rate of depression and anxiety cite(gender differences in mental health afifi M). 

Cultural differences also influence the development of mental disorders. There are cultural bound syndromes, which are disorders that are more likely to occur in certain culture and context. For example, obesity and anorexia nervosa in the United States (OBESITY AS A CULTURE-BOUND SYNDROME ), social withdrawal in Japan (Hikikomori, a Japanese culture-bound syndrome of social withdrawal? A proposal for DSM-V). Cultural stigma also restraint the help-seeking behaviours of people from a certain culture. A person live in a culture full of stigmatizing image of mental health may internalize these ideas and suffer from a diminish in self-esteem and confidence(Corrigan, 1998; Holmes and River, 1998). 

In summary, a lot of the predisposing factors, such as personality, self-disclosure and self-esteem, are dependent on family rearing style. It's nearly impossible to extract childhood information of a person from social media data, because social media only exploded in the recent decade. However, it's possible to extract information that reflects predisposing risk factors from social media data. As a result, my project will involve studying some of these disposing factors. Predisposing factors makes up the vulnerabilty of mental disorders, but predisposing factors alone are not directly link to mental disorders. Their interaction with precipitating factors - stress, are most predictive of mental health.


\subsection{precipitating factors and perpetuating factors}

Life stress has been acknowledged as an important factors in illness onset (citation). It has been found that major life events, such as divorce, death of a closed friend or relative, being fired from work and so on are precipitating factors on mental illnesses (citation). However, the correlations between stress and health outcome is confound by many factors, such as the predisposing factors in the previous sections. As a result, the correlations between stress and health are modest (r =  0.2 - 0.4)  The correlations are much stronger among those who are already ill. cite (Aldwin and Gilmer, 2004).

\subsubsection{measurement of stress}
Most of the literature analyze stress from two perspective: psychological and environmental perspectives. The psychological perspective focuses on the individual's appraisal of their ability to cope with stress, while the environmental perspective focuses on the life events that cause the stress cite ((McGrath, 1970)). 

However, measuring stress level with the type of stressor is far from accurate due to individual differences in assigning meanings to life events. Objective rating of life events, for instance, assuming that bereavement must be extremely stressful, does not account for the individual differences.  Wortman
and Silver (1989) (cite) found that one-third of the bereaved spouses do not appear to be distressed at any point up to one year after the spouse's death. Thus, subjective ratings of stress are more predictive to mental health conditions.  Scales that measure the subjective rating of stress include Schedule of Recent Life Experiences (SRE) cite(), the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) and so on (cite). Another way to measure stress is the interview. Interview measurement is particularly critical in diagnosis because the timing of exposure to the stressor indicate the onset of the illness.

\subsubsection{types of stress}
\textbf{Random stressors and systematic stressors}. Random stressors occur with relatively equal probability across various social group, e.g. miscarriages. Systematic stressors happen in specific social location or social group, e.g being robbed. 

\textbf{Chronic and accute stressors.}  Accute stressors result in onset of illness, while chronic stressors expose an individual to long-term stress. Both of them play an important role in the development of mental disorders. However, sometimes the boundary of chronic and accute stressors are not clear cut. In fact, many negative events are not uniformily evaluated as discrete or chrnoic (Avison and Turner, 1988). For instance, a car accident is an accute stressor, but the injuries follow with the accident can take years to recover, which makes this accident a chronic stressor.

\textbf{Change events and negative change events.} There are consistent findings that supports a positive relationship between negative change event and mental illness. A large amount of studies shows that negative events rather than positive events precipitate symptoms} (Rabkin and Streuning, 1976; Turner and Wheaton,1995). Whereas, the findings for positive event and mental illness are contradictory. cite (Zautra and Reich (1983). As a result, life event checklists emphasis the undesirability as the most important factor to mental illness. 

\subsubsection{Other aspects of stress} 
\textbf{Uncontrollability of event.} It is also important to note that uncontrollable event is more stressful than those that are under an individual's control. For example, initiate a breakup with a partner is less stressful than being told the bad news by a partner; Being fired is more stressful than quitting a job. 


\textbf{culmulative of stress and role strain.} It is believed that the accumulation of stress is more stressful than an isolated life events (Evans, 2004). The literature suggests that the duration of stress effect usually lasts for 6 months (Depue and Monroe, 1986; Norris and Murrell, 1987). In addition, chronic role strain and hassles may also increase the severity of the illness.

low social status increases the risk of being exposed to a number of adverse conditions, both physical and psychological (Adler, Marmot, McEwen and Stewart, 1999; Adler and Matthews, 1994).
