The 4P model is a biopsychosocial approach to analyze mental health development and progression \cite{}. The 4P model suggests that there are four types of factors contribute to development of all psychological disorders, each type of factors can be further divided into biological factors, psychological factors and social factors. The four types of factors are: predisposing risk factors, precipitating risk factors, perpetuating risk factors and protective factors. 

Predisposing risk factors make an individual more susceptible to a psychological disorder. For example, genetic component, gender differences, personality traits and parental modeling. Precipitating risk factors contribute to the onset of psychological disorders, for instance, traumatic event or stressful life events. Perpetuating factors maintain the symptoms span from psychological disorders, such as chronic stress, cognitive bias, social stigma, social roles. Finally, protective factors build up the resilience of an individual \cite{}. Figure \ref{tab:4P} demonstrates the relationships of these factors. Note that some of the precipitating factors can be perpetuating factors if they exist for a long time. 

We attempt to study some of the factors via the lenses of social media platform. Social media behaviors reflect psychological and social factors to some extend but it's nearly impossible to inspect biological factors from social media data, except for gender differences. Another factor that is difficult to inspect in social media at this stage is childhood experience. As a result, my PhD project will only focus on inspecting factors that are available in social media data.

\subsection{predisposing factors}
When individuals are exposed to a stressor, predisposing factors influence how people experience stress and how they cope with it. These factors affect an individual in the probability to encounter stressors. Note that people select their environment and shape them. They also affect people's tendency to react to situation and their tendency in coping. \cite{} (Suls and Martin, 2005; Vollrath, 2001; cf. Watson, David and  Suls, 1999)

\subsubsection{personality}
There has been consistent evidence showing that personality plays an important role in the experience of stress, in particular, coping with stress (e.g., Kiecolt-Glaser, McGuire, Tobles and Glaser, 2002).


There are many types of personality models, such as, Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI),Cattell’s 16 Factor Model, Big Five Model, among which the five factor personality model (Big5) is most widely adopted in personality studies. Big5 suggests five board dimensions to describe human personality:  openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

\subsection{precipitating factors and perpetuating factors}


low social status increases the risk of being exposed to a number of adverse conditions, both physical and psychological (Adler, Marmot, McEwen and Stewart, 1999; Adler and Matthews, 1994).
